# Less Distraction Theme

A "less" distraction (based on the [No Distraction Theme](https://standardnotes.org/extensions/no-distraction)) that looks a little like iA Writer. 

You can still see all of your notes on the left side of the screen and access them quickly, but you reduce the clutter on the right side of the screen. After all, when you're working, you don't need to change editors, or publish, or see the title (it's already on the left side of the screen.) I prefer it to the standard layout in most cases. [Let me know what you think](https://github.com/alecstein/sn-less-distraction/issues).

This theme layers nicely with the [iA Writer Quattro Theme](https://github.com/414119/sn-ia-writer-quattro).

As seen on my own custom theme (if you're interested, I'll publish that too.)
