# Less Distraction Theme

A theme that looks a little like iA Writer. But not totally empty, so that you can still access your notes quickly and easily. It's a reduced version of the [No Distraction](https://standardnotes.org/extensions/no-distraction) theme which layers with other themes. The font is a little larger as well.

After all, if you can see which note you're working with on the left side of the screen, and you're not changing the editor, and you're not publishing, you don't really need the top toolbar at all. So it seems like it might be a little comfortable for long term writing than the standard layout. [Let me know what you think](https://github.com/alecstein/sn-less-distraction/issues).
